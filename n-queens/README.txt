CS2233 Algorithms WPI

An algorithm that places “n” Queens on an “n” x “n” board so that no two queens attack 
each other, where “n” can be any number greater than or equal to 4. 

n-queens-First-Solutions: displays the first solution for any "n" greater than 4.
n-queens-All-Solutions: displays number of total board solutions for each "n" ranging from 4 - n.
